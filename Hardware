THE TWO WAY MIRROR - is assembled in the frame, thenm adding the strip of wood at the bottom of the frame to support.
MONITOR- which is installed at the back of the mirror.
RASPBERRY PI WITH SD-CARD- in the computer. Download Rasbian from raspberrypi.org/downloads. When the ZIP-file is extracted you need Win32 Disk Imager. You can download it at sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/. Install and start it. Klick on the folder icon and browse to the folder where you have the Raspbian files. Make sure that the destination is the SD-card (in my case D:)
When the write is successful, you just take the SD-card and put it in your Raspberry Pi. Connect to the computer screen, add a mouse and keyboard, and start it.
In my case, I came directly to the desktop on start. To make the right configurations you need to open the terminal and enter "sudo raspi-config". In there, you are going to do three different things. First, "expand filesystem". Second, choose "Boot Options" and then choose to boot to 
Desktop  GUI with the "pi" user.

WODDEN BOARD FOR THE FRAME.
