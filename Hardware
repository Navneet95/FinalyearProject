the hardware structure of the project is almost done and soon will be uploaded with connection details.
the two way acrylic mirror is assembled in the frame, thenm adding the strip of wood at the bottom of the frame to support.
after this, mounting is done. Depending on our install location  we need to run some sort of power to the mirror.
Software will be initiated this week 
the coding will be done in C and libraries will be uploaded soon as we are still working on some hardware structure for the home automation.
